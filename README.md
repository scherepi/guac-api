## GUAC-API
---
a very basic api intended to serve a bunch of little functions, the main one being a journal users can register for and then write to.
features include:
- a very simple *djb* hash!
- **multi-user** journaling!
- feeling like a celebrity? post something to the *communal journal*!
- documentation for everything provided at __/docs/endpoints__
- a nice little hello at the root directory :)
- more soon if i come back to this!! (working on terminalcraft at the moment... keep an eye out for XFilBuddy!)
